									<h2>The Diagnosis</h2>
									<p>
										In November of 2019, I was hit by a van while crossing the street (on a walk sign, in case the question crossed your mind) to campus. 
										I was lucky that I had no serious injuries. In fact, excluding some soreness on the left side of my body from the impact, I felt great! 
										A few weeks later, however, my whole body started to ache. And with that came a shooting pain in my big toe whenever I placed weight on my left foot.
									</p>
									<p>
										Thus began the weird procession of specialist visits. The podiatrist did imaging on my foot and found a swollen joint, but he couldn't explain it so 
										he sent me to a rheumatologist. The rheumatologist told me "You're too young for arthritis!" (thank gosh!) but sent me for a bunch of blood tests. 
										And that was when they found the celiac antibodies. So, off I went to see a gastroenterologist, where I was eventually diagnosed with celiac disease.

									</p>
									
									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>What is Celiac Disease?</h2>
									<p>
										Celiac disease is an autoimmune disease where the body produces an immune response to consuming gluten by attacking the small intestine. This leads to villi, 
										the lining of the small intestine, which means that the body is not able to absorb nutrients as well. In the long term, this can lead to serious health complications.
									</p>
									<p>
										People with celiac, therefore, have to cut gluten completely out of their diets. This includes any sort of cross contamination! For example, if you touch your knife 
										to a slice of bread and then put it back in the jam jar to scoop some more out, I can't eat jam from that jar. It's that serious.
									</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>The Idea</h2>
									<p>
										Being gluten free is not easy, especially when you love to eat out with your friends and try new restaurants. In fact, ordering from restaurants is one of the hardest 
										parts, because it is hard to guarantee that there will be no cross contamination. In June, I joined my best friend and her dad on a road trip to Southern California.
										Every time we wanted to stop for food, I would have to look at the restaurants near us, google their menus to see if they had gluten free options, and often when there was
										no information about that, I would have to call and ask. Many restaurants will not guarantee the food is gluten free, which made it extremely hard to find a place to eat.
										One night we drove to every restaurant near us to ask before giving up and just heading to the local grocery store to buy frozen meals!
									</p>
									<p>
										This experience was really frustrating for me. I kept thinking, there must be other gluten-free people who know of the GF options in this area. If only there was some way
										to share that information! And so, the idea for my app was born. A way to crowdsource GF-friendliness information about different restaurants, all by GF people!
									</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>How Do I Make An App?</h2>
									<p>
										While I was super excited about my idea, I also was completely unsure of where to get start. While I have learned a lot from my classes at the University of Washington, I have to
										admit that the knowledge we learn in our 10-week courses does not exactly translate to writing a mobile app. I reached out to one of my high school CS mentors from the TEALs program,
										Mike Schmidt, who gave me some insight on how to start. I asked around a bit more before deciding that I would learn React Native to build my app. After that, I would explore options
										for a database to store the information I plan to crowdsource through this app. Great, finally I had a plan!
									</p>

									<hr class="major" />

									<h2>Learning React Native</h2>
									<p>
										After being put in touch with a software engineer with an experience in app development, he recommend a Udemy course on React Native and I dove right in! I am currently working through the course's
										38 hours of tutorials, and am excited to learn all there is to know about React Native. Most recently, I created an application displaying a square, that when tapped, changes colors. I will continue
										to update this page as I make progress. Thanks for partaking in this journey!
