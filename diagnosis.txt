In November of 2019, I was hit by a van while crossing the street (on a walk sign, in case the question crossed your mind) to campus. I was lucky in that I had no serious injuries. In fact, exclusing some soreness on the left side of my body from the impact, I felt great! A few weeks later, however, my whole body started to ache. And with that came a shooting pain in my big toe whenever I put my weight on my left foot.
Thus began the weird procession of specialist visits. The podiatrist did imaging which found a swollen joint, but he couldn't explain it so he sent me to a rheumatologist. The rheumatologist told me "You're too young for arthritis!" (thank gosh!) but sent me for a bunch of blood tests. And that was when they found the celiac antibodies. So, off I went to see a gastroenterologist, where I was eventually diagnosed with celiac disease.
